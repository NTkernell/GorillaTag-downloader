<p> All of these builds are legaly obtained through steam depots or the offical Gorilla Tag Discord server. For steam depots we use DepotDownloader. For historical builds we obain them from the Gorilla Tag Discord then reupload them to our github archive.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>Please understand that i am just one person so you wont see new builds come up instant. You may see updates every 2-6 weeks depending on what i have time for.   &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are concerned or worried about putting your steam credentials in i can assure you that it is perfectly safe. They are needed just so we know you own the game before you download and are not commiting piracy. Your password does not get sent to us, it is only sent to the steam servers. If you are still hesitant feel free to either dm me on Discord @nt.kernel or join the Discord server which is linked in the github page. We are happy to answer your questions.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If one of the builds is not working please either join the Discord server and go to support or create an issue on GitHub and i will get to fixing it. Please do not make an issue if you are not certain its a gtag downloader problem and not a specific problem to you.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
